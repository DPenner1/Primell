The [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of mathematical programming challenges. I've created solutions here to show Primell/Listell in action. In particular, many Euler problems involve prime numbers, and Primell is geared towards computing with primes.

Additionally, solving Euler problems may lead to new features in Primell if I find existing syntax/functionality too cumbersome (in unintentional ways).
